############################
## Some notes from Elif's Modifications to Parameter Fitting
##
## *) I removed NiMnIn_Au from Brian's data directory, it was not tetragonal and doesn't work
## *) it is finding some non-duplicate duplicates
## *) first task should be to separate out the rules sums calculations from the post-processing -- first make the pp file, then calculate sums
##
## *) As implemented right now,
##      several parts of this code assume that the VASP POSCAR/CONTCAR always enter Ni,Mn,In in the
##      same order.  You will be in trouble on many levels if this is not actually the case.
##      For instance, atom.py assumes the species order is NiMnIn always.
##
## *) Generally, would be good to slightly overhaul m_structure so that it ONLY contains the
##      information necessary to do the fitting and to run MC simulations.  It is carrying around
##      a lot of information we don't need.  Cleaner to leave it behind when its not needed.
##
## *) we should make an option to just read cluster and j sums from summary rather than regenerating each time
##
## *) Look at m_structure.py line 86 for minor question.
##
## *) need to assess degree of overfitting in model using cross-validation in sklearn. Can we improve the model?
##
## *) When doing the fitting, is selecting an intercept a problem? cluster expansion model inherently
##      expects non-centered data?  Otherwise it spends it energy pulling out the linear dependence on composition.
##      Note: fitting is currently modified so intercept is not fit, need to change cfp.ridge_simple if we want
##      to include it.  But I think we do not.
##
## *) SEE if we can recover Brian's fit. Then do changes in line 100
